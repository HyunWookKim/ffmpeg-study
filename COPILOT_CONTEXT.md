# GitHub Copilot Context Guide (Conversation History)

## ü§ñ How to Continue with Copilot in Next Sessions

### 1. üìÇ Opening Project Files
When you open this project folder in VS Code, Copilot automatically recognizes the project structure.

### 2. üí¨ Key Phrases to Start Next Session
Tell Copilot in the next session:

```
"I previously developed an M1 Mac FFmpeg project with VideoToolbox hardware acceleration 
and GUI video player. Now it's been ported to Windows with cross-platform support, 
SDL2 integration, and all Korean text converted to English. 
Please refer to DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md to continue our work."
```

### 3. üîç Context Hints to Provide
- **Current Status**: "Cross-platform FFmpeg project with Windows support, GUI video player, and hardware acceleration"
- **Technology Stack**: "FFmpeg 7.1.1 + VideoToolbox (macOS) + D3D11/DXVA2 (Windows disabled) + SDL2 + C++17 + Multithreading"
- **Key Files**: 
  - `examples/advanced/gui_video_player.cpp` (SDL2 GUI player with enhanced progress bar)
  - `examples/advanced/hardware_decoder.cpp` (Hardware acceleration, platform-specific)
  - `examples/advanced/video_player.cpp` (Console video player with auto-exit)
  - `CMakeLists.txt` (Cross-platform build with SDL2 integration)
  - `WINDOWS_SETUP.md` (Windows development environment guide)

### 4. üéØ Progress Status to Share
"The project has been successfully ported to Windows with cross-platform support.
All 9 examples build and run on Windows. SDL2 GUI video player works perfectly.
Korean text has been converted to English, and progress bars display properly.
Both macOS VideoToolbox and Windows software decoding are supported."

- Software decoding with proper performance
- Enhanced progress bar: [DECODE] [####################] 100% (59/59) SW
- UTF-8 character encoding with ASCII-only output
- Auto-exit functionality and improved queue monitoring

**macOS Testing (Previous Sessions):**
- H.264/HEVC hardware decoding (420+ FPS, loop playback)
- Hardware‚Üísoftware frame transfer (NV12 format)
- Multi-threaded Producer-Consumer pattern
- Automatic loop playback and decoder flush
- Dynamic pixel format conversion (SwsContext)
- Keyboard event handling and playback speed control
- Various video filter effects

### üöÄ Future Enhancement Areas
- WebRTC browser communication
- Windows D3D11/DXVA2 hardware acceleration (currently disabled due to compatibility)
- Core ML AI analysis (macOS)
- Metal Performance Shaders (macOS)
- Qt-based cross-platform GUI
- Cloud streaming integration
- Video filter pixel format improvements

## üí° Tips for Effective Context Transfer to Copilot

### 1. Attach Relevant Files
When starting a conversation, attach these files so Copilot understands the current state:
- `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` (Complete development process across all sessions)
- `README.md` (Project overview with cross-platform setup)
- `ADVANCED_GUIDE.md` (Detailed feature descriptions)
- `WINDOWS_SETUP.md` (Windows development environment guide)

### 2. Make Specific Requests
‚ùå "Add video-related features"
‚úÖ "I want to add playback speed control to video_player.cpp. While maintaining the current multi-threaded structure, enable 1x, 2x, 0.5x speed playback."

### 3. Specify Current State
"Currently VideoToolbox hardware acceleration works on macOS, and Windows uses software decoding. 
The video_player.cpp has producer_thread and display_thread communicating via frame_queue."

## üîÑ Session Continuation Checklist

When starting the next session, verify:

- [ ] Project folder is open in VS Code?
- [ ] Have you shown `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` to Copilot?
- [ ] Have you specified concrete goals for what you want to work on?
- [ ] Have you explained which parts of existing code you want to modify/extend?
- [ ] Have you mentioned the current platform (Windows/macOS) you're working on?

This approach enables Copilot to quickly understand the previous conversation context 
and provide continuous development assistance! üöÄ
